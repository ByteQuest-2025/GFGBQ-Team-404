# Sentinel - Real-Time Audio Fraud Prevention
## GFGBQ-Team-404

### Overview
Sentinel is an intelligent, real-time audio analysis platform designed to protect vulnerable populations such as the elderly and first-time internet users from the rising tide of voice-based scams. Unlike traditional systems that analyze fraud after a transaction is complete, Sentinel identifies malicious intent during the live conversation.

### Problem
**Targetting the Vulnerable:** Fraudsters exploit elderly and digitally unaware users through phone calls.

**Psychological Pressure:** Scams use urgency, fear, and emotional manipulation which are difficult for users to identify in the heat of the moment.

**Protection Gap:** Most current tools offer post transaction analysis, which works after the damage is done, leaving users unprotected during the actual call.

### Solution Overview
Sentinel is an AI-powered, browser-based application that monitors phone calls in real-time and alerts users to potential scams before they fall victim.
